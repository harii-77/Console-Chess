### Advanced Chess Rules ✨

- **Castling**: Both kingside (O-O) and queenside (O-O-O) castling
  - Automatic validation of castling conditions (king/rook not moved, path clear, not in check)
  - Special notation support: `O-O`, `0-0`, `O-O-O`, `0-0-0`
- **En Passant**: Automatic pawn capture when opponent's pawn moves two squares
  - Proper timing validation (must be captured immediately)
  - Automatic removal of captured pawn
- **Pawn Promotion**: Interactive promotion when pawn reaches back rank
  - Choose from Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight
  - Logged with special notation
- **Complete Move Validation**: All chess rules properly implemented
  - Prevents moves that would put own king in check
  - Validates piece-specific movement patterns with enhanced algorithms

### Enhanced Game Features ✨

  - Move counting and organization
- **Save/Load Game State**: Full game persistence with backward compatibility
  - Save games with custom filenames: `save mygame`

  - Preserves board state, castling rights, en passant status, move history
  - Automatic `.sav` file extension handling
- **Comprehensive Move Logging**: All game events logged with timestamps
  - Game start/end logging with player names
  - Move notation in proper chess format (1. e2e4, 1... e7e5)
  - Capture detection and special move logging (castling, en passant)
  - Special events: check, checkmate, stalemate, pawn promotions
  - Thread-safe logging with automatic resource management

### Visual & UI Features

- **Enhanced Visual Display**:
  - White pieces: `[P] [R] [N] [B] [Q] [K]` (uppercase in brackets)
  - Black pieces: `(p) (r) (n) (b) (q) (k)` (lowercase in parentheses)
  - Color-coded pieces: bright yellow for white, cyan for black
  - Perfect board alignment with centered empty squares: `.`

## Prerequisites

- Java 11+ (JDK)
- Maven 3.6+
- Windows users: optional `run.bat` convenience script included

Verify tools:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
mvn -v
```

### Install Maven on Windows (if `mvn` is not recognized)

1. Download Maven (binary zip) from `https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi`.
2. Extract to a folder, e.g., `C:\Program Files\Apache\maven-3.9.x`.
3. Add `C:\Program Files\Apache\maven-3.9.x\bin` to your System PATH.
   - Windows Search → "Edit the system environment variables" → Environment Variables → Path → Edit → New.
4. Open a new terminal and run `mvn -v` to verify.
5. Alternatively, use the Windows script in Option 3 (no Maven required).

## Run the Game

### Option 1: Maven (cross-platform)

```bash
mvn compile exec:java
```

### Option 2: Build then run

```bash
mvn compile
java -cp target/classes com.consolechess.ChessGame
```

### Option 3: Windows batch script

```bat
run.bat
```

This compiles with `javac` and runs the game without Maven.

### Option 4: Pre-built JAR file

```bash
java -jar console-chess-1.1.0.jar
```

The JAR includes all latest advanced features, comprehensive improvements, and bug fixes.

### Option 5: Windows JAR launcher (recommended for end users)

```bat
run-jar.bat
```

Convenient Windows batch script that launches the JAR directly with version display and pause functionality for easy distribution.

### Option 6: Manual compile and run on Windows (no Maven)

If you prefer direct `javac`/`java` commands:

```bat
REM Create output folder if it doesn't exist
if not exist target\classes mkdir target\classes

REM Compile all sources (including MoveLogger)
javac -d target\classes -cp target\classes src\main\java\com\consolechess\*.java

REM Run the game
java -cp target/classes com.consolechess.ChessGame
```

## How to Play

1. Start the program and enter player names when prompted (enhanced validation included).
2. Enter moves in coordinate notation: `e2e4` means from `e2` to `e4`.
   - Files: `a` to `h`, Ranks: `1` to `8`.
3. **Available Commands**:

   - **Movement**: `e2e4` (standard notation), `O-O` (kingside castling), `O-O-O` (queenside castling)
   - **Information**: `pip` (show all valid moves), `help` (show all commands)
   - **Game Control**: `quit` or `q` (exit game with proper cleanup)
   - **File Operations**: `save <name>` (save game), `load <name>` (load game)

4. **Advanced Rules Implemented**:
   - **Castling**: Use `O-O` for kingside or `O-O-O` for queenside castling
   - **En Passant**: Automatic - just move your pawn diagonally to capture
   - **Pawn Promotion**: When pawn reaches end, choose `Q`, `R`, `B`, or `N`
   - **Check/Checkmate/Stalemate**: Automatically detected and announced

### Game Display

- **White pieces**: `[P] [R] [N] [B] [Q] [K]` - displayed in bright yellow
- **Black pieces**: `(p) (r) (n) (b) (q) (k)` - displayed in cyan
- **Empty squares**: `.` with perfect alignment (space-dot-space format)
- **Move logging**: All moves logged to console and `logs/chess_game_TIMESTAMP.log`

### Advanced Command Examples

Enter your move: O-O-O        # Queenside castling
```

#### Save/Load Examples

```
Enter your move: save mygame    # Saves to saves/mygame.sav
Enter your move: load mygame    # Loads from saves/mygame.sav
```

- **File Format**: Custom format preserving all game state
- **Content**: Board position, castling rights, en passant status, move history
- **Usage**: `save <filename>` and `load <filename>` (`.sav` auto-added)

### Move Analysis (pip command)

- **Display**: All legal moves for current player
- **Categories**: Regular moves, captures, special moves (castling, en passant)
- **Format**: Algebraic notation with move descriptions
- **Count**: Total number of available moves

## Logs Directory

The game automatically creates a `logs/` directory where all game sessions are saved with timestamps:

- **Format**: `chess_game_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- **Content**: Complete game history with move notation, player actions, and special events
- **Features**: Automatic file creation, proper resource cleanup, error handling

Example log files:
