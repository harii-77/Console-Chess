├── ChessGame.java      - Main controller (845 lines)
├── Board.java          - Game board logic (976 lines)
├── Piece.java          - Piece representation (322 lines)
├── Position.java       - Position handling (293 lines)
├── Player.java         - Player management (241 lines)

## Advanced Features Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Move Validation

The game implements complete chess rules with sophisticated validation:

```java
// Example: Castling validation includes:
- King hasn't moved
- Rook hasn't moved  
- Path is clear between king and rook
- King is not currently in check
- King doesn't pass through check
- King doesn't end up in check
```

### 2. State Persistence

Full game state serialization including:
- Complete board position
- Castling rights for both players
- En passant target square
- Move history
- Current player turn
- Player names

### 3. Move Analysis System

The `pip` command provides comprehensive move analysis:
- Lists all legal moves for current player
- Categorizes moves (captures, castling, en passant)
- Shows move counts
- Formatted for readability

### 4. Multi-Format Display

Supports four display modes:
1. **COLORED_BRACKETED**: `[P]` (yellow) for white, `(p)` (cyan) for black
2. **UNICODE**: Chess symbols (♔♕♖♗♘♙)
3. **PLAIN_BRACKETED**: `[P]` and `(p)` without colors
4. **SIMPLE**: `P` and `p` notation
